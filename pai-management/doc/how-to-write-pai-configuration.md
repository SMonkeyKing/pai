# PAI Configuration

Before deployment or maintenance, user should have the cluster configuration files ready.

You could find the example configuration files in [pai/cluster-configuration/](../../cluster-configuration).

Note: Please do not change the name of the configuration files. And those 4 files should be put in the same directory.


## Index

- [Set up cluster-configuration.yaml](#cluster_configuration)
- [Set up k8s-role-definition.yaml](#k8s_role_definition)
- [Set up kubernetes-configuration.yaml](#kubernetes_configuration)
- [Set up serivices-configuration.yaml](#services_configuration)
- [Kubernetes High Availability Configuration](#k8s-high-availability-configuration)

## Set up cluster-configuration.yaml <a name="cluster_configuration"></a>

An example cluster-configuration.yaml is available [here](../../cluster-configuration/cluster-configuration.yaml). In the following we explain the fields in the yaml file one by one.

### ```default-machine-properties```

```YAML
default-machine-properties:
  # A Linux host account with sudo permission
  username: username
  password: password
  sshport: port
```

Set the default value of username, password, and sshport in default-machine-properties. PAI will use these default values to access cluter machines. User can override the default access information for each machine in [machine-list](#m_list).

### ```machine-sku```

```YAML
machine-sku:

  NC24R:
    mem: 224
    gpu:
      type: teslak80
      count: 4
    cpu:
      vcore: 24
    #Note: Up to now, the only supported os version is Ubuntu16.04. Please do not change it here.
    os: ubuntu16.04

```

In this field, you could define several sku with different name. And in the machine list you should refer your machine to one of them.

- mem: memory
- gpu: If there is no gpu on this sku, you could remove this field
- os: Now we only supported ubuntu, and pai is only tested on the version 16.04LTS.

### ```machine-list``` <a name="m_list"></a>

```
machine-list:

    - hostname: hostname (echo `hostname`)
      hostip: IP
      machine-type: D8SV3
      etcdid: etcdid1
      #sshport: PORT (Optional)
      #username: username (Optional)
      #password: password (Optional)
      k8s-role: master
      dashboard: "true"
      zkid: "1"
      pai-master: "true"

    - hostname: hostname
      hostip: IP
      machine-type: D8SV3
      etcdid: etcdid2
      #sshport: PORT (Optional)
      #username: username (Optional)
      #password: password (Optional)
      k8s-role: master
      node-exporter: "true"

    - hostname: hostname
      hostip: IP
      machine-type: NC24R
      #sshport: PORT (Optional)
      #username: username (Optional)
      #password: password (Optional)
      k8s-role: worker
      pai-worker: "true"
```

- ```hostname```: Required. You could the hostname by the command ```echo `hostname` ``` on the host.
- ```hostip```: Required. The ip address of the corresponding host.
- ```machine-type```: Required. The sku name defined in the ```machine-sku```.
- ```etcdid```: K8s-Master Required. The etcd is part of kuberentes master. If you assign the k8s-role=master to a node, you should set this filed. This value will be used when starting and fixing k8s.
- ```sshport, username, password```: Optional. Used if this machine's account and port is different from the default properties. Or you can remove them.
- ```k8s-role```: Required. You could set this value to ```master```, ```worker``` or ```proxy```. If you want to configure more than 1 k8s-master, please refer to [Kubernetes High Availability Configuration](#k8s-high-availability-configuration).
- ```dashboard```: Select one node to set this field. And set the value as ``` "true" ```.
- ```pai-master```: Optional. hadoop-name-node, hadoop-resource-manager, frameworklauncher, restserver, webportal, grafana, prometheus and node-exporter.
- ```zkid```: Unique zookeeper id required by ```pai-master``` node(s). You can set this field from ```1``` to ```n```
- ```pai-worker```: Optional. hadoop-data-node, hadoop-node-manager, and node-exporter will be deployed on a pai-work.
- ```node-exporter```: Optional. You can assign this label to nodes to enable hardware and service monitoring.

Note: To deploy PAI in a single box, users should set pai-master and pai-worker labels for the same machine in machine-list section, or just follow the quick deployment approach described in this [section](./single-box-deployment.md).

## Set up k8s-role-definition.yaml <a name="k8s_role_definition"></a>

An example k8s-role-definition.yaml file is available [here](../../cluster-configuration/k8s-role-definition.yaml).
The file is used to bootstrap a k8s cluster. It includes a list of k8s components and specifies what components should be include in different k8s roles (master, worker, and proxy).
By default, user does not need to change the file.

## Set up kubernetes-configuration.yaml <a name="kubernetes_configuration"></a>

An example kubernetes-configuration.yaml file is available [here](../../cluster-configuration/kubernetes-configuration.yaml). The yaml file includes the following fields.

```
kubernetes:
  cluster-dns: IP
  load-balance-ip: IP
  service-cluster-ip-range: 10.254.0.0/16
  storage-backend: etcd3
  docker-registry: docker.io/pai
  hyperkube-version: v1.9.4
  etcd-version: 3.2.17
  apiserver-version: v1.9.4
  kube-scheduler-version: v1.9.4
  kube-controller-manager-version:  v1.9.4
  # http://gcr.io/google_containers/kubernetes-dashboard-amd64
  dashboard-version: v1.8.3
```

### ```User *must* set the following fields to bootstrap a cluster ```

- ```cluster-dns```: Find the namesever address in  /etc/resolv.conf
- ```load-balance-ip```: If the cluster has only one k8s-master, please set this field with the ip-address of your k8s-master. If there are more than one k8s-master, please refer to [k8s high availability configuration](#k8s-high-availability-configuration).

### ```Some values could use the default value```
- ```service-cluster-ip-range```: Please specify an ip range that does not overlap with the host network in the cluster. E.g., use the 169.254.0.0/16 link-local IPv4 address according to [RFC 3927](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3927), which usually will not overlap with your cluster IP.
- ```storage-backend```: ETCD major version. If you are not familiar with etcd, please do not change it.
- ```docker-registry```: The docker registry used in the k8s deployment. To use the official k8s Docker images, set this field to gcr.io/google_containers, the deployment process will pull Kubernetes component's image from ```gcr.io/google_containers/hyperkube```. You can also set the docker registry to openpai.docker.io (or docker.io/pai), which is maintained by pai.
- ```hyperkube-version```: The version of hyperkube. If the registry is gcr, you could find the version tag [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/google-containers/GLOBAL/hyperkube?gcrImageListsize=50).

- ```kube-controller-manager-version```: The version of kube-controller-manager.If the registry is gcr, you could find the version tag [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/google-containers/GLOBAL/cloud-controller-manager?gcrImageListsize=50)
- ```dashboard-version```: The version of kubernetes-dashboard. If the registry is gcr, you could find the version tag [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/google-containers/GLOBAL/kubernetes-dashboard-amd64?gcrImageListsize=50)

## Set up serivices-configuration.yaml <a name="services_configuration"></a>

An example services-configuration.yaml file is available [here](../../cluster-configuration/services-configuration.yaml). The following explains the details of the yaml file.

## Kubernetes and High Availability (HA) <a name="k8s-high-availability-configuration"></a>

### ```Deploy Kubernetes on a Single Master Node (without HA)```

Single master mode does not have high availability.

- only set one node's k8s-role as master
- set this field ```load-balance-ip``` to your master's ip address

### ```Kubernetes with High Availability: The `proxy` Role```

There are 3 roles in [k8s-role-definition](../../cluster-configuration/k8s-role-definition.yaml). The ```master``` will start a k8s-master component on the specified machine. And the ```proxy``` will start a proxy component on the specified machine. In cluster-configuration.yaml,

- one or more than one nodes are labeled with ```k8s-role: master```
- one node should be labeled with ```k8s-role: proxy```
- set the field ```load-balance-ip``` to your proxy node's ip address

Node: the proxy node itself is not in ha mode. How to configure the proxy node in ha mode is out of the scope of PAI deployment.

### ```Kubernetes with High Availability: External Load Balancer```

If your cluster has a reliable load-balance server (e.g. in a cloud environment such as Azure), you could set up a load-balancer and set the field ```load-balance-ip``` in the kubernetes-configuration.yaml to the load-balancer.

- Set the field ```load-balance-ip`` to the ip-address of your load-balancer.
